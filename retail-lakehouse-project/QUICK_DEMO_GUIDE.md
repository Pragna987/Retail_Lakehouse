## 🎤 Presentation Script (What to Say)

### **Opening (10 seconds)**
> "This is my Retail Data Lakehouse project using Medallion Architecture. Let me show you the complete dashboard."

### **Business Analytics Section (30 seconds)**
> "The first section shows business analytics across revenue, customers, inventory, and marketing. We analyzed 16,050 records generating $12.9M in revenue. You can see monthly trends, customer demographics, and product performance."

### **Machine Learning Section (45 seconds)**
> "The ML section has two models:
> 
> **Customer Segmentation** - Using K-Means clustering, we identified 2 distinct customer segments with different spending patterns. The 'Slipping Regulars' segment has $8.9M in revenue at risk.
> 
> **Demand Forecasting** - Our Gradient Boosting model forecasts 30-day demand for 1,000 products. It identified 206 high-priority products needing immediate reorder to prevent stockouts."

### **Business Impact (20 seconds)**
> "Combined, our analysis identified **$2.37 million** in revenue opportunities - $1.78M from re-engaging customers and $594K from smart inventory management."

### **Technical Stack (15 seconds)**
> "The tech stack includes Python, PySpark, Delta Lake, scikit-learn for ML, and pandas for analytics. Everything is fully documented with reproducible results."

**Total presentation time: ~2 minutes**

## 🎯 Common Questions & Answers

### **Q: How much data did you process?**
A: "16,050 records across 4 datasets - transactions, customers, products, and marketing campaigns."

### **Q: What ML algorithms did you use?**
A: "K-Means for customer segmentation and Gradient Boosting for demand forecasting. Both achieved good performance with actionable insights."

### **Q: Can you explain the Medallion Architecture?**
A: "It's a 3-layer design: Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned), Gold (business-ready). We have ETL scripts for each transformation layer."

### **Q: What's the business value?**
A: "$2.37M in identified revenue opportunities through customer re-engagement and optimized inventory management."

### **Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: "Yes - it's designed for Apache Spark with Delta Lake, scalable to millions of records, and includes comprehensive documentation."

## 🎨 Dashboard Navigation Tips

1. **Top Section**: Key business metrics (revenue, transactions, customers, products)
2. **Business Analytics**: Click tabs to switch between Revenue/Customers/Inventory/Marketing
3. **Machine Learning**: Click tabs to switch between Segmentation/Forecasting
4. **Scroll down**: See all visualizations and detailed tables

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ **Before presentation:**
- Run `python quick_demo.py` to ensure dashboard opens
- Have browser window ready (dashboard auto-opens)
- Practice the 2-minute script above

✅ **During presentation:**
- Let the dashboard speak for itself (very professional-looking)
- Click between tabs to show different analytics
- Point out the $2.37M business impact

✅ **If time permits:**
- Show the segment breakdown (2 customer groups with metrics)
- Show the top 5 products needing reorder (color-coded priorities)
- Mention the interactive nature (tabs, embedded charts)
